<h1>All the world's a stage coach</h1>
<hr><h2>Sep 24 2003</h2>
O Indian maiden, o dark-hued virgin of mysterious skies, O my heart, palpitate no more,
for I cannot further bear, endure, suffer this pain!  I wonder sometimes why in all
of our grand world there remains not one ounce, not a dram, not a farthing, of love
for yours truly, selfish though perhaps it seem to the unkind observer included not
among which may not be U.<p>
So how ever lovely a day it was today, as September wanes, giving way, giving solace
to October, and Solstice as well.  O my unrequited lover, the death of surely as many
of us as one might be persuaded to count, persuade me tonight, Fate, to tell...<p>
So as you may or may not have been aware, I harbored for a rather long time a harmless
(nay, harmfus) "crush" on one Miriam Bonner, none could equal her influence on me,
none her charms, none her freedom of very spirit.  O where have you gone, pseudonymous
babe, anonymous force in my life.<p>
I've been having trouble sleeping lately, what with my hormones.  I have tried desperately
to keep them in check. And then come tugging the cosmic forces, at me, at my loins, at my
very soul.  Why they do not leave me alone to dejected sopor I shall never know.
<p>
Nay, back to the task at hand.  My goddess, my exquisite, I saw her, today, at the ice
cream store, the #2 ice cream store whose identity I shall not reveal.  She wore a baggy
shirt, so baggy as to leave much to the imagination, and untucked at that.  But beneath
this unassuming shell, she wore polyester pants, tight as anyone's surely without the 
approval of her father, that jackal.  And I saw her walk, almost gliding, to the restroom,
and back, toward me, her shirt occasionally flipping in her breeze to reveal the sleek
undercurrents of the northern tides... How I could not escape this, I know full well.
These pants, whomever manufactured by, have done me great service and great misdeed,
I'm afraid.  I've no idea what to do with myself, but to recollect her svelte form.
I envision something more, but only hintingly, a soùpson of something intensely private,
intensely fearsome, some thing I know I shall never see.  But nay, I see photographs
on occasion, but of othes; is this not sateity in vicarious image?  It is far more real, my friends,
than this.  Far more true, far more haunting.  I summon to my memory these black pants,
at once upon the girl and doffed, concealing beneath that most exquisite form, that I have
so desired.  My love is unquestionable, unwavering, impossible.  I cry out, I love, I cry.
<p>Her motion, as innocent and casual as a common cat's, yet so significant to one so
blesséd as me.  And were I to see more, I could not fathom my life from that point forth.
I love her, Nidhi, Schmidhi, I have such an urge to explode from within myself, to sprout
fangs, to bite through all my misery, my ill fortune, to you!  I see you, but I do not
have you for mine, my lover.  My dearest precious thing, my 
<p>
R. Flemton Howell<br>
<i>Ode to a lady's dress</i><br>
Her sleekest belly, her stern yell<br>
Her sash a beacon, the shore tells<br>
The sails limp amid dawn breeze<br>
My hands cold, tremble knees<br>
My love dawns, its spectre young<br>
Be still, my wakeful tongue, I quell<br>
As sure as snake a leopard smell<br>
My destiny to me is yeast, rise<br>
Thou bred thy progeny from lies, begone!<br>
I love thy self, thy breast, thy ohhhhhh<br>
<br>as ammended this 24th septembre 
<hr><h2>Sep 13 2003</h2>
O CURSED FATES, TRYING HEAVENS, MEDIOCRE PURGATORY!!!!  Why have I of all
mortal souls been saddled, deprived of sopor, bereft of sanity (a
grievance amended I might add), starved for daylight, starved for sustenance,
struck and sunk by the oh so fitting-to-me delights of a woman. A fellow human
she is not, a human yes, but nay, greater than life, beyond my personal reach,
beyond India itself.  She is one woman in 500,000, cut from the same cloth as
MOHAN whose cloth's girth necessitates reevaluation of many a sort and species
of measuring stick and mine own sticktuitiveness, o destiny.
<p>However vexing and paralizing might remain my frustrations, my logic has not
in its erraticity forsaked me.  A telephone call well placed, a message left,
only the beginning of a cosmically guaranteed plan, or so one could only wish
longingly as in general one does of this feeble life.  The heavily accented
tone not unfamiliar to me grew wary as I identified myself as Mohan's friend,
agitated even, I dare say the aftermath of the scandal hath mathed its fetid
claws and fangs, but grew warier still, to the point of exhausted duress,
exhumated digestion, upon the mention of their daughter, that purest radiant
of unspoiled earth and fire.  They demanded, not subtly, to know why I called.
I could not tell them the truth, o so ever much as I wished to proclaim it to all
from the rooftops of the finest buildings.  I could neither weave a lie around
Mohan for his fate is sealed, he is sealed in a fat camp.  My dilemma thus presented,
what pray tell good friends might I have said?  Lo and behold from forth
my lips was launched a void of empty perception, a black hole of epic proportions.
Vee dont believe our daughter should be speaking alone to young men.  I say unto
thee, fuckers!  What what ever o shall I do, my friends?  I love another, trapped
in a dungeon of Indian parentage, a tower in which her radiant hair grows longer
by the bushel, crying out to those below, Rapunzel me my friends, but how, in this
our harsh reality, might I do that?<hr><h2>Sep 11 2003</h2>
Well as quickly as he came blubbering onto the scéne, MOHAN has gone the way of so many
scuzzy housewives.  The incontrovertible shame aside, his parents could not afford the stampede
into their shock absorbers, and indefinitely his fate lies at fat camp.  What manner of
retreat could this entail?  Bivouacáge á le piscine?  Fathoms of arduous submerged jogging?
I envy him not, to say the least.
<p>And as I bade him farewell at his doorstep, his sister descended their grand staircase.  Her
radiance deflowered me, devoured me, Schopenhauered me. Her eyelashes alone were the radiant
sunbeams of lore, her lips the tangerines of ambrosia.  From forth her emerged a song, a poem
of sight and sound, "Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiivvvvvvvvvvvvvaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrr."
Her sultry gown billowed about her, a drape before the window of her body, her soul.  My facial
regions suffered the algal inferno of a crimson tide, and I gibbered hello, fleetingly.
<p> O such an Indian beauty as there never was; a time for yearning past, the time for rampant
throes of purple desire, textured demands, exquisite replies, makin' out in the ol' thèátre....
One comprehends the suggestion.  I allude to locked lips, locked souls, intertwined, bewitched,
infuriated with a positive anger, a terror of the night, an elegy for the day past and the day
to come, and for the time to be.
<p>Despite my free will, my blustering, I am made a wreck, a shell of my self, <i>en face de</i> of 
her succulence, her promise of sweet sopor...
<p>My frustrations start so soon; I fear for my sanity! If only the 19th century were so
forgiving of innovative behaviour... Obscurity hides the true... another forgotten genius of the age, E.J.W. Rosenquist, 
could claim to years later have made an indelible mark on me, if only wistfully.
<p>
<b>I would not be a boor but built at home
<br>E.J.W. Rosenquist</b>


<br>I would not be a boor but built at home
<br>The gentlest, tacit, purest cautious shrine.
<br>I offered to thee of my fondest poem;
<br>Presumptions free to make, prayed makest thine.
<br>A caution, nay reluctance I admit
<br>Thy lips, thy cheek but countenancèd here.
<br>O wherefore found those greater men their grit,
<br>Replaced my wheeze by serenade and leer?
<br>My love intact, my heart lies dormant--why?
<br>Would fonder men try fondling, else aside,
<br>Usurp from me flirtation? I defy:
<br>Propriety, decorum, manners lied!
<br>So please go out with me and copulate
<br>And preferably the first or second date.<hr>

You can call me a man of the world, or a knave of the stage, or a boy of the underworld.  I will not be offended 
whatever you may see fit as my moniker.  Chief on all our minds is medical school apps, of course.
How could we be permitted to forget for an iota, never a quiet luxurious sopor, nay, tension 
forever ingrainéd.  Ingenious though he may be, our Mohan, or as I have come to know him, the 
Fat Bastard, cannot distance for a moment himself from this ardor, but for a wee nip in the park,
a cafè perhaps.  A poet at heart, truly, as immersed in pointless drivel as the rest of us.
I have found it curious, however, that his difficulty writing about his erstwhile self proves
as much a chore as I have hubly discovered trawling this cerulean sphere for submerged meaning.
<p>I received word as well of one Reese and her latest 'catch.'  Perhaps one could catch cod,
in her inimitable net.  Her hips, repulsive as they are sexy, could turn the sea, dredge the 
depths of your soul, surely.  I've a strange notion that one Randall McTiernan is spinning in his
watery grave.  
<p>Speaking of high speed screws, I believe I shall be off now to what might be ineptly termed
a 'Mohanvaganza.'
<p>but first, words of wisdom from the great R. Flemton Howell, who showed once and for all the 
19th was like the last of the teenage years the greatest of all centuries.
<br><i>R. Flemton Howell
<br>	Do you find it hard to write about yourself, or is it just when you try to write yourself off???
<br>	Beauty is eternal, love transcendent, life worse still.
<br>	My introspection was cut short one day by an arrow in the brain.
<br>	There's no use trying to find the root of your troubles, unless you're a farmer.
<br>	-But Mabel, my barren wife, my ground teems with young corn, and yours languishes torpid and unfertilized.
<br>	-My dear Frank, are not some fruits best left to the imagination?
<br>	A woman can no better endure a frank critique than a once-over by a pack of sailors.

</i><p>Are you listening, Reese?
Ho ha, I should not be caught dead in feckless panties, purple shirts, nor beside an emaciated 
chap with a purse, or a 'tote' euphemistically disguiséd. Can you not see him for the girly girl
he is, that you wish you could be?  Is this what you long for in a 'bf?'  I kid of course, my honey darling moopsy poo.  Time to vomit all over MOHAN
<hr><h2>Thursday, July 10, 2003</h2>

<p>I should like to entitle this one: My Evening with Mohan. I was most flattered to receive word from one MOHAN that he desired my august company at an uptown sort of forgettable cafè. I shall in my mercy spare you the details. Suffice it to say that we danced the night away. My wit was on fire, his on fire as well. Ah, wit. My truest ally, truer than Ally McBeal. I abhor the trite, ingather the maiden wood of free will. And that was not, if I may wax risquè, the only maiden wood ingathered this evening! Subsume my soul, my very soul! Ye gods! WE ARE THY BURNING GAZE... ....

<P>And a moment of condolence for Randall McTiernan, a brave soul, insofar as he was permitted to imperil his by the burning gaze of freer spirits (no inauspicious pun intended). As surely as R. Flemton Howell wished his favourite grandmother, Rest In Pieces.

<p>There comes a time when one must survey the beauty that is life, and 

with one's discriminating taste in elegance, beauty, verifiability, 

permittability, mutability into something which may itself be lauded 

rather than lambasted. Such a time was a most unfortunate incidental 

accident as I waited en queue at the local cinematic establishment, as 

I waited with my ostensibly hot date (in truth a gawky girl who is 

balding, a mere acquaintance due to her increasing condition of pate 

exposè). I said to her, of what this evening my dear wouldst thou care 

to avail us? It is not possible to quantify or qualify my 

consternation. Why o why must life in its infinite rhythm, mercy, 

possibility send me the way of Legally Blonde 2?

Imagine if you will a confluence of the unholy, the unwholesome, the 

unrealistic, and the umbrella pigeonholing of a hemisphere...

Might I express in a poem just how I feel about this atrocity of a 

film:
<br>
<br>Glowering dungeon denizens, awake!
<br>A sunbeam smileth upon thee
<br>A word for it, "fake"
<br>Upon which you should flee
<p>
And then I was seized by a most unruly emotion, to the depth of my 

soul, it shook my brain. Who was I, Where was I, What was I? Fate took 

me by the slitted wrist and led me up a staircase to a wondrous 

landing, and no sooner having reached it did hurl me toward hell. My 

own life is my least posession, I shall donate it to Goodwill. I shall 

without reluctance finance my shotgun wedding with Death.

Occasionally in my more dreary moods, I contemplate world upheveal. Today 

was just one of those moods. I joined a certain ironic organization, viz. 

the Ironic Socialistas. I have high hopes that we can bring some decency 

back to the decline of civilisation, riding the torrents of dissent to the 

peak of true instability, then back into a demure mayhem. On a personal 

note, we went again to Schlotzky's where my nemesis, that MOHAN, was 

googling his peepers at my baybeh most unabstemiously. Or might I say 

instead, "Ick?!" or some such trite phrase of disgust.

Blast the confusion to which certain unfortunate people are susceptible. Somewhat irked, but not yet infuriated, I demanded with no uncertain (albeit forcedly restrained) urgency that my sandwich (of the rye-and-deli-meats variety) be doused in a greater allocation of mayonnaise than the opinion of the sandwich-maker, whose opinion one might plausibly favour over mine, that of an amateur sandwich aficionado, permitted by default; and my request was summarily declined. Let's just say this is the last time I shall frequent Schlotzky's until my judgment is again impaired by intractable hunger.

Like a sword, the truth is double-edged. Like the most obstinate of choices, the choice to tell the truth is multifaceted, unruly. Ah, decisions. Man's aeternal nemesis. The isolation of one man's truth cannot, will not overcome its fortified boundaries, will not surmount its epistomolgical dungeon's periphery.

<p>Is this the pinnacle? Is this the acme to which mortals strive day in and day out, perennially toying with their lackadaisicality.

<p>My aim, say I, can be two-fold. Firstly, aenumerate my obstacles, and lastly, aemerge victorious. The vast gulf in between is what distresses me. My distress might descend into madness, spiralling with a perverse beauty like that one might find in a pinwheel.
