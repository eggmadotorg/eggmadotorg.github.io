<h1>My only benefits in life are damages...</h1>
<HR><H2>Sep 24 2003</h2>
hey guys.  well guess what. im afraid its over with me and the rene.  lets play the
"_____... IN BED" game.  well i went out with him for a while, i saw his 
coffee shop with him, and then i realized he kinda disgusts me... IN BED.  hehe isnt
that the most fun youve had IN BED.<p>
i went shopping with wai-san today, we went to the #2 underwear store, i wont say
what it is =p.  i found the most adorable thing: <i>Accès interdit</i> brand panties.
im sure that will turn a few heads, if you know what i mean. actually, what do i mean?
all i know is im not being mean! =ppppp<p>
i went back to the movie theater again, i always go by myself bc nobody is interested
in movies apparently, or at least not in bad ones.  i saw that guy again, and this 
time he couldnt say hey a half chinese girl bc he already said that last week although
i guess he kinda won, but i dont like him one bit. although it is cool that he noticed
i was half chinese.  how many people are so hip as to know that, i ask you?<p>
hip, hip, hip, hooray!!!!!!!!!<p>
so i watched underworld, it hurt my ears, i had to put my hands over them and i felt
like a wuss like i couldnt take some kids movie, but then i figure all the better
to give YOU an audience when someday im queen of the world, when someday the mighty
half chinese empire rises again, free of the minimally regulated capitalist ways
that crippled it for the better part of a century.  im serious about this, we
had to flee on a hovercraft.  my friend the other half chinese girl doesnt love me,
she loves some fat f***, she loves him so much.<p>
i cant help but thinking sugar ray is a shitty version of sublime.  god i love sublime,
they remind me of my ex-bf. no not randy, he was a total square, he liked john mayer.
jk i like john mayer too.  i dont understand why other people dont like him, hes
good, hes a proficient musician and hes got rhythm and hes got music, who could
ask for anything more??? and josh kelly is just a shitty version of john mayer.
his song is good but he could only make one.  thats like when you sit around in a lab
trying to play god and you make 1 cell and you say HA im god now, i have made a cell,
lets have champagne, but then thats it.  and you get hit by a bus next year.
a BUSiness deal.  jk i hate business, i saw what it did to randy, it was relaly
horrible what it did to him, i could see even though we werent going out.<p>
i love you wai-san, i dont getmany chances to say this, but im drunk, i want to
cry out, to all lovely girly girls on this godforsaken sphere, i bequeath to thee
my heart, my soul, half of my oscillating personality, 5 days out of every month,
etc. jk dont worry honey baby im there 4u, 4ever, 5 on u if u say otherw-ise hehe 
nm its an inside joke obv. byeeeee!<p>
p.s. you might have been wondering all this time why i made my name reese
winterspoon.  well im not a big fan of reese witherspoon, shes kind of puffy
(esp. since shes pregnant but i guess thats not her fault--no wait, yes it is!).
one time i was so scared i was pregnant bc of an unfortunate splattering incident
we need not go into.  i felt so dirty, so unsexy, and it was like my life was over.
and i know it would have been huge if i had really been pregnant.  i was so freaked
out i broke up with my bf over it.  he didnt understand what i was talking about.
he was kind of stupid, plus he didnt speak english.  i really liked him though, im
sorry it had to end that way, with me unprepared to maybe be pregnant, him thinking
fate had just turned agaist him, although i guess it kinda did didnt it since hes
no longer with meeee! jk and hes not a proud father, or an ignominious deadbeat
as the case may be.  
<hr><h2>Sep 13 2003</h2>
my mom called me today, she said it was raining alot. it was raining alot here too.
my mom and i are so much alike. esp. our personality.  i think were the only people
we know who open cereal box bags w/ a knife.  she asked me how my new bf was and 
i told her hes fine and she was like thats greaatttttttttttt reeeeese, im so gladddddddddddd
that hes okkkkkkkk, do you think you really get along with him?  and i was like um
not really actually, hes kind of a prick.  and she said reeeeeeesssssseeeeee, i know
youll work it out, you always do!   i think maybe, shes deranged.  maybe.  i think
she took the whole randy thing harder than anybody, incl. him (jk).  i really feel
sorry for him.  if there is one word for the whole thing its Stupid.  theres no 2
ways about it.
<p>but enough negative stuff =P im very excited about my mom coming to visit.  of course
she told my dad and he was like thats greattttttttttttttt reeeeese, im so gladdddddd
you get to see your mooooommmmmmmmmm. im like yeah right, youre the one who said i
shouldnt touch her with a ten foot communist pole.  i think he was maybe kidding about
the communist part, shes a more ruthless capitalist than hes.  im still not sure what
they do, all i know is its ruthless.  utterly ruthless.  but im not ruthless, im
ruthful.  im full of ruth.  you might call me, ruthse ruthterspoon.
<p>but dont think im going to show YOU any mercy, punk! jk...
<p> im going to bed now, im worn out from playing mario bros.  no im not a geek.
i dont live with my parents, htats impossible, theyre divorced.  i think my bro is a
much bigger geek than me.  btw hes actually my half bro, and hes 100% chinese.  i think
that would explain why hes such a slob.. jk!!!  he has lived with us since before i can
remember.  he lives with my dad now even though hes not related at all.  i think
the custody dispute involved vicodin. seriously, my mom is the most random person.
one time she went to macys and said ALL I WANT IS MACE! GIVE ME MACE!  and then she
went to foleys with a real live foal, and then she saw nieman marcus and didnt know
what to do and the foal pooped in the mall and she got arrested.  and my mom got a
ticket.  my mom used to tell me that story anyway.  i dont know how much of it is
true.  i dont even like to go to macys, those women smell like shit frankly.  and
they want me to smell like them!  what is this, some kind of smellrority?  thats
really a lame name for it if they want to have one.  and then they act like theyre
so cool.  well i have tight pants too, and im pleased to say i always fit them.
there is nothing more tragic than a group of five or more women.  one of them is
bound to have sthg wrong with her.  like, she will try to wear the same clothes but
unlike the others she has a gut.  or her boobs are 10x smaller than everyones.
i sometimes feel like m. night shmamalan, i make up stories for how people are going
to meet their fate, only i also think about how they have overweight friends or
theyre overweight but their husbands not, or they have an unhappy home life.  i also
go around predicting the world will not end in the next 30 minutes.  omg, there are planes,
rockets outside!  an air raid siren!  jk its not armageddon.  but i know one thing:
armageddon out of here! byeee<hr><h2>Sep 11 2003</h2>
im interested in switching words around. like, "he spends more time in coffee shops than ivar".
im not intending to say that he spends time in ivar!  only one person is stupid enough to do 
that, and that is MOHAN.  how could anyone stand ivar with his oh heavens above, bestow 
upon me great meaning.  i cant believe i used to like him... i guess esp. since hes gay.
im embarassed to say that i wrote MOHAN in the dust on my bed, which has NOT BEEN USED 
IN SOME TIME.  hehe jk.  
<p> i luv fishes cuz theyre so delicious...<p>
im reading about this group of women in 1953 that barricaded themselves inside a garbage truck
and they wouldnt come out till their husbands promised to take out the trash.  im thinking about
my bro, he always took out the trash.  on the other hand, he had 10 times as much trash as me,
and majority rules.  but then one day he comes to me and says so, bucko, its your turn to take
out the trash, i realized you use up 9% of the trash space but you take out the trash 0% of the time.
well not today sis, im going to make you do it every 8th time, to be fair and then compensate me
for all that time i did 100%.  i was like go dither in your room fathead , and i bought my own trash can.
his trash was so gross, i dont even know what some of that shit was.  maximum boobs newsweekly???  i didnt even think he liked 
women.  maybe its their clothes he doesnt like.
<p>sigh, i dont know what to do with myself.  i was thinking about world domination, but then 
i realized the daily show was coming on in half an hour.  it made me cynical enough to think 
my being in power would only ruin life for me and everybody else. why mess up an already
brilliant legacy of the clinton white house and monica and richard nixon.  i love richard nixon,
hes so corrupt its funny.  i liked the way he talked, even if he was lying.  sort of like woody allen.
<p>
i went to the movie theater today and the ticket guy was like WHOA A HALF CHINESE GIRL.  and i was like
yeah, whats the big deal.  he said well i only date half chinese girls.  i said um do you know the difference
betw necessary and sufficient conditions?  he just gave me a blank look.  and i watched how to deal
starring mandy moore.  he told me he saw it and it was really good but he had a creepy look on his face 
so i couldnt tell if he was being serious.
so i paid $10 to see it.  whos the jackass now im wondering ='''(.  and as i was leaving i gave him a dirty look
and he said do you know the difference between liability and culpability?  touchée.
<p>byee
<p>p.p.s. no im not going to say whether i slept with eric r., thats not appropriate conversational content, as you must know, sweet cheeks. mystery is the foundation of our glamour, as im sure somebody said, if not (c)2003 reese, yeahhhh!!!!.  byee!!!
<hr>
<h2>Sep 08 2003</h2>
im a little irked by my new bf.  he wont stop changing radio channels. 
im thinking of reaching over and taking the dial. hes never going to find unpopular 70s music.
but i love his cds. why doesnt he put in one of those.  our radio still has a dial, we are living in
1955.  i wonder if we should even HAVE a radio.  sometimes i worry i have lost sight of everything.
im afraid our innocence is a bit more hidden, to say the least.  i for one am operating at a 1963 level.
  the music of the 90s is all loud, its 
giving me a headache.  but i would have had a headache anyway. sigh... i want to lie down again.
renes comp chairreally sucks, even though i think it cost like 200 thousand dollars.
 im going to have to tell you 
though about this bf. i didnt think it was possible but he spends more time in coffee shops than
ivar.  i dont know what it is about pricey caffeine and guys, but i kind of like it.  except 
def. not in ivar, not unless is not unless you consider the hairs on the back of your neck
an erogenous zone.  warning ladies and gentlemen, we are entering the erogenous zone... jk.
<p>im going to take a nap soon, i think rene is going to borders or sthg.  im excited about this
reading theyre having there by women poets that he found.  he gave me the flyer as a paper airplane!
 i think in these last few years female poets have really started
to make an impact, and i aim to find out why!  im rambling now.  why does every word ending in
-ing have to be "flipping," let me ask you that?  im so flipping tired, im flipping about flipping down now.
=P talk to you soon, reese.  p.s. hang in there wai-san =)<hr>

 oh my god.... randys mom called me at like 2am and she 

said he drove his car off a bridge and when they got to 

him he had drowned.  oh my god... and they said his bac 

was like 1.9%..
<p>
i knew he was having some problems with his business club 

or something and he got kicked off some committee or 

something and he seemed really bummed about being on a mid 

echelon committee or something i dont know but i never 

ever thought he would do something like this.  this is 

just beyond words.  i dont understand life right now... i 

felt like shit since yesterday but that just all went 

away.  i feel like nothing i do matters anymore.  and im 

still here, typing in my room, and something terrible has 

happened.  i wasnt there, i couldnt have been, its almost 

like i didnt know randy anymore.  but now i just wish he 

were back, even though we werent dating.
<p>
theres this guy on tv, hehe, hes dancing like a girl and 

hes wearing a blue sombrero with sparkles.  now theres a 

commercial for womens deodorant where the girl is at a 

party and shes trying to talk up these guys and they all 

laugh at her and then she does a keg stand and she starts 

to dance on the hood of a car and she starts unbuttoning 

her shirt and then it says ¿porque no apenas fresh lady?
<p>
alcohol seems so glamorous, its like its not even the same 

thing as... im lost, utterly, utterly lost.  i feel loss, 

and realization, and trepidity, and an infinity of other 

emotions all rolled into one. but above all, im numb, 

insensible, insentient.  im not going to cry, i wont let 

myself.  or maybe i cant admit that i should.  i feel so 

guilty for toying with the idea of a watery grave in my 

own bathroom.  i balked at the mold in the tub.  i feel 

like such a fucking brat.  but randy died on a river bed 

with incalculably worse mold, and he had no chance to turn 

back.  i feel in my heart he would have turned back if he 

were only as lucky as i was and knew what he was getting 

himself into.  i feel like i want to die but im staying 

right here.  its just so selfish to think of dying when 

you have a choice.
<p>
goodbye randy, we'll miss you. );:

<hr><h2>Thursday, July 03, 2003</h2>

 omg i saw mohan at heb.  he was buying a lot of hamburger helper.  i was too 

nervous to go talk to him.  i mean what if he needed to concentrate on 

shopping, like me?  except i sure as hamburgers couldnt concentrate then!!!! 

omg... well so, i was going to just "happen" to be in the same checkout as 

him, but then he started looking at these salad dressings for like TEN 

MINUTES and i was like wow he must love salad and i got bored and i started 

twiddling this tube of sausage and it broke open! and i got the sausage 

stuff all over these juice boxes... um, i didnt see anything...  so then i 

thought i had better go somewhere else.. but then i lost track of him! and 

then i saw him walking out the front door and i was holding all these 

groceries and i would feel dumb just leaving them.  and then the woman in 

front of me was buying like a MILLION things of hi-c mix and there was some 

problem with the price or something but it was the shortest line.  i was 

like why dont you just type in 500x instead of swiping each individual one.  

so eventually i came home.  and then i realized i forgot some of the stuff 

at the store.  you win some you lose some, i guess...

 i think i have a crush on mohan, the guy at the schlotszkys.  i went there 

today and he said "heeaaaaayyyy," as if to say "hello comma sexy 

exclamation point whats up if youll pardon my french."  thats precisely 

what he said.  MOHAN & REESE, SITTING IN A TREE. ..  ...mmkay too graphic 

there.  but have you seen thsi guy?  i think hes into pinkton hue because 

he braided the front of his hair and died it red.  thats gotta be a hue 

thing.  i didnt get a chance to ask him bc he was too busy cussing at the 

mayonnaise bottle which had clogged up at the top and the bottom of the 

spout thingy.  hes so funny tho, he said "gud dom u bottool of SHIT! i am 

goink to gum in dair and stob you with a fok!"  i think he was makin fun 

of apu nahasapimapetulan.  apu is so like that.. anyway... im going to get 

another sandwich tomorrow, or maybe later today.  hes going to make me fat 

and then he wont love me anymore by the time i get up the nerve to ask him 

out.  i wish it was his resp... o well, cant win em all, ask for social
