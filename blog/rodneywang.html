<p>reesewinterspoon: rodney dont kill yourself believe me
<br>reesewinterspoon: you dont know what youre dealing with
<br>reesewinterspoon: surely youve seen enough to know that by now
<p>she always brings me back down to earth... &_@!
<p>
it's my first weekend in college, i'm sitting in my dorm watching tv.
shouldn't i be out "partying," as it were?  perhaps i should be imbibing
alcoholic sustenance, or some such thing.  my roommates of course are not 
here, they said they were going out, so long.  i didn't like the way they
said "long."  i wish they would stop with their subtleties and come right 
out and say something.  i'm not quite sure what they would say... perish
the thought....
<p>i was the only one in the cafeteria and i smiled at the dishwasher woman
and i don't think she liked me, i think i saw her whispering to her coworker
and they were giggling and pointing a lot.  of course there was also an 
amusing poster right behind me.  i never looked at it directly, i'm weird
liek that sometimes.. i don't see the forest for the trees.  i can only hope
that it didn't have arrows pointing right at my head or something.
<p>sigh... what am i going to do.  i need to stay alive, stay focused. but 
sometime's it's just SO HARD.  arghhhhh, i had better watch anime now.

<br>Most of her ass, and leveraging most of yours, bitch
<hr><h2>Sep 11 2003</h2>

sigh.  i think i should take a moment to apologize for being so needy in the past.  i really
saddled you guys, and for that i'm sorry.  i could not see past my own problems.  i have learned
now to be strong, to be independent, to figure out what i want.
<p>SIGH.  i overheard my roommates talking in the bathroom. they said something that made it
sound like they were afraid i would lust after them in their sleep.. something like "how do
you know it won't be YOUR girlfriend at night, if you know what i mean."
i promise you this makes me a lot more uncomfortable than it makes them!  i thought about
confronting them about it, and apologizing for any misunderstanding, and begging them to be friends
(jk), but i realized i was probably being dumb.  i'm going to really like college...

<h2>Sep 08 2003</h2>
i moved into my dorm today.  i have this room with two other guys, and they know each other.  great.  
then i was in the cafeteria, by myself, feeling pathetic, and i started thinking, why can't they make the ketchup wrapper printing line up?  it's so stupid....
my roommates hadnt' been moved in for 6 hours when they decided it was time to violate the drug policy.  i felt a little out of place to be sure.  but then i figured, rodney, what are you clinging to?  elementary school?  i had about 1/10 of a joint.  it was enough to make me lose my mind and believe that they liked me.  then they watched the man show for about 3 hours, at least that's what it felt like when i was doped up.  the juggies really do have magnificent colored costumes.
<p>
<br>current mood... dreaming of trampolines.... oy vay...
<br>current food... ugh i will never eat again, i thought my turkey tetrazini days were over
<br>tetrazini dayz....
<p>
i can't help but feel jealous of reese every time she gets a new bf, but i guess she's just lucky. at least that's what i tell myself at night.  im going to bed, try not to think about it, sleep off the drug overdose..
<p>
<b>Boyz in the Ass</b>
<br>
<br>You got me comatose waitin, droolin up my adult bib
<br>Let me roll you a joint, then we gonna roll to my crib
<br>I seen you last mornin dancin, you be glib as a Kennedy
<br>But they love you like John Cornyn, drunk you like Hennessy
<br>I got the munchies, bitch, raise yo crotch up my way

<br>Round these parts in my hood they might term this play
<br>It's a classy ass job when we fuhhh tonite
<br>You be Jerry Fuckheimer and I'm Michael Bay.
<br>
<br>The boys in the ass are always hard,
<br>Keep tappin that ass they can fuck you hard
<br>Shut up bitch, don't wanna hear you bitch
<br>And I'll quote you tomorrow for your friends, you bitch
<br>

<br>Keep tappin that ass they can fuck you hard
<br>Keep shootin that mouth off, I'll shoot off in your trap
<br>And you best keep it there till you show your dad

 my life is upside down again. i'm totally confused.  sometimes i feel like i 

can't put my finger on the truth i know is out there somewhere.  someone said 

to me today, you know you're rodney, rodney wang.  i guess i had forgotten 

even that.  i. am. rodney. wang.  i regret coming out because i feel like i 

was just jumping on the first thing to cross my mind.  oy gevalt.  &}&
<p>
reese's ex-bf committed suicide tonight.  but i declare, life goes on.  i am 

rodney wang.  i am alive, i have my wits about me.  i am strong.  i am proud. 

 nothing can get in my way.  i need to get a girlfriend and stop pushing 

myself farther into a rut.  but is not a rut made worse by moving forward?  i 

hereby fiat into fleeting existence a truckload of gravel and i will drive up 

it to safety.  i hope my analogies do not bore you.  but sometimes i am less 

in the mood of a cart and more in that of a brutal dictator with tragic flaws 

that tend to inhibit careers.  this is the first day of the rest of my life.
<p>
current mood: on top of the world

big spoon)

 that guy MOHAN called me on the phone out of the blue. i didn't know what to think.  i half thought what if he's GAY. and i got kind of a chill.  i guess that means the machinery is all working... then he asked me if i wanted to watch legally blonde 2.  i was like uh... maybe anotehr time.  i had a weird feeling about that.  i mean who is this guy, calling me otu of the blue?  and legally blonde 2?  it was panned by critics.  or at least it was panned by IVAR who saw it for some reason.  i don't tihnk i want to see a movie with chihuahuas.  period.  no pun intended.  so anyway, i eventually said i had to take out the garbage, which was a lie.  i then stood alone in my house, in my tight t-shirt, surveying the scene.  my house feels gross and empty.  i'm going to kill myself.
<p>
ok i'm not going to kill myself.  don't worry y'all.  but darned to tarnation if i should know what to do now.  oy gevalt.

 man that mohan who works at schlotzky's is obese.. i wanted to ask him if he has been eating on the job.  but i didn't think of that till after we had left.  reese keeps making us come there with her.  ivar said, most appropriately, "if i might quip so boldly, we are going on another whale watch of the new england variety." &-8 ... i guess she is entranced by his folds upon folds of blubber.  i guess you might even say, is it him eating the sandwich or the sandwich eating him.. actually thtas kind of an inside joke.  hehe.

 so... now what?  i don't feel the void i heard i would feel.  i watched will & grace today.  i don't know if i like grace, she seems so materialistic.  and why is that rich woman working for her if she's so rich?  we went to schlotzky's today and reese was like ga-ga over this indian guy. i didn't think he was that attractive.  i mean come on, a braid on the front of his head?  sooo 80s.   but i was half jealous cause reese said he might have been looking at her like he was interested or something.

i wish this was going to be easy but i don't know how i'll ever have a relationship.  not that i really want one right now but still.  i just can't see it happening, even remotely.  what if i'm doomed to be a friend, a "gay boyfriend" i remember having heard it called.  i must say i kidn of like the sound of that.

 oy gevalt. i feel like i have reached a turning point, like something has to give.  no, i'm not going to kill 
myself. anwyay, i don't know the best way to say this.  I'M GAY.  there, i said it. i feel like a whole weight 
has been lifted.  i alwasy felt like i was different but i couldnt' admit it to myself. i'm scared of what will 
happen now. my friends are gonna have to help me thru this, and it'l lbe tough.  i just feel so liberated. i 
dont' have to be ashamed of listening to the googoo dolls and country anymore.  i don't have to be ashamed of 
being in touch with my sensitive side.  i wonder if my friends already knew.  this is probably why i never 
wanted to make out with reese at prom in 9th grade.  of course i didn't belong at the prom anyway.  uh oh, now i 
have a really bad feeling. i don't know who i am.  oy vay.  maybe i could be sexy in a yarmokuh.  my parents 
don't know who i am anymore, and they can never know.  i ahte them. i hop they won't start to hate me. it feels 
weird that we always used to make gay jokes but now we won't anymore.  whenever people say gg fagits i'm going 
to start taking it personally, cause i have eto stick up for my people. who is my people?  the chinese?  gay 
people? i dont know any gay people.  the jews??? i am totallyh alone, and not the good kind of alone.  i'm 
afraid to tell anyone to their face or even on im.  i'll just tell them to read this.  kind of round about but 
oh well.  so, hello, all you peopole reading this.  i'm sexy, fabulous &_&. what does it mean to be gay? i don't 
really think about men like ivar.  but on tv i alwasy liked agent mulder better than agent scully.  i wished i 
was scully so bad when i was 12.  but i want to be sexy. and i like girl stuff. no, i'm not going to become a 
transsexual. now that is just sick.  am i sick too? i don't think so.  what if my family already knows. what if 
they hate me already?  i'm never going to tell them. never. sorry to end on a bad note.  i feel weird ending in any way. this is such a new experience.
