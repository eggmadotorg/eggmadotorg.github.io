<h1>Biographies</h1>

<h2>Eric Rosenquist, violin</h2>

As the inspiration and originator of the Eggma Trio, Eric is one of its proudest members. Many of the recordings and practices were held at his home on his Kawai upright piano.
<br><br>
Eric's prestigious violin career can be traced back to middle school where he stunned teachers and made his peers jealous. His impeccable technique along with his perfect pitch rocketed him to the top of the middle school chairs. Unfortunately, his concert career was abruptly cut short after dropping out of orchestra in high school. 
<br><br>
Eric's first freelance chamber performance was with the renowned Andrew Wang and Peng.  Eric led the ensemble in Shostakovich's second trio from the piano bench and ended up with with a memorable recording of the difficult piece. 
<br><br>
After a one year hiatus from performing, Eric made a comeback with the Eggma trio in the summer of 2001. His rapid improvement can be traced from recording to recording, culminating with his second stunning interpretation of the Shostakovich trio, this time on the violin. His versitility as a musician is simply unmatched.
<br><br>
Recently Eric has performed on viola, substituting for the cello in the first Shostakovich trio. His next challenge is to perform as a single quartet in the upcoming recording of the Shostakovich piano quintet.  This challenge was ultimately abandoned because of time and artistic constraints.


<h2>Rajat Mathur, clarinet</h2>

Rajat Mathur, musician and composer extrordinaire, smashed on to the stage at the tender age of 13 and never looked back. Although sometimes reluctant to attend rehearsals, Rajat proved himself to be among the best players in the Eggma Trio, even while refusing to practice.
<br><br>
Rajat was also one of the best players at his middle school. Only one clarinetist could ever compete with him, but that only strengthened his resolve to be the best. During high school, Rajat was involved with many wind ensembles, small and large, and he honed his skills at playing chamber music. 
<br><br>
During his spare time, Rajat composed many orchestral and instrumental pieces. Rajat also collaborated with Jeff Cobb and the late Franz Liszt to create a fanciful melody that gained him acceptance to the prestigious music school at the University of Houston. 
<br><br>
Although he never touched his instrument during the year prior to Eggma, he found no trouble in returning to play even the difficult runs of Khachaturian. Rajat has proven that he has staying power, and this will not be the last you hear of him.
<br><br>
Rajat has recently refused to perform with the Trio anymore. This unfortunately means these recordings are the last you will hear of him.


<h2>Jeff Cobb, piano</h2>

Jeff Cobb, master of both the piano and the trumpet, is the co-creator of Eggma and also gave it the name. Jeff is also the recording specialist who set up and made all the recordings of the ensemble.
<br><br>
At first he was reluctant to start the trio because of thoughts that nobody would ever follow through. However, after the first rehearsal, things looked up, and it became apparent that this group of engineers might be able to pull something off. 
<br><br>
Jeff began playing piano at the age of eight, sponsored by his generous grandmother. He played independently for eleven years until finally joining the Eggma trio in his first chamber performance. He was the motivator of the group, organizing all practices, recordings, and performances. His house was also the alternative venue for rehearsals when Eric's was unavailable.
<br><br>
Jeff's passion for music and fantastic skills contributed to the success of the ensemble, which will undoubtedly be around for many years to come.


<h2>Sound Blaster Live! Value, cello</h2>

Sound Blaster Live! Value is a featured guest artist with The Eggma Trio. Its debut came with the groundbreaking Shostakovich trio recording in Summer of 2002. Utilizing two separate Soundfonts for the slow, low pitched cello parts and the higher or pizzicato sections, Sound Blaster Live! Value's playing rivals that of even the most respected cellists.
<br><br>
Sound Blaster Live! Value is taught the music by meticulously typing all the notes into Noteworthy Composer and recording the output. Its strict adherence to tempo makes it ironically difficult to perform live with, and most recordings featuring it were recorded with its part dubbed in later.


<h2>Jennifer Tsai, cello</h2>

Jennifer Tsai is a featured guest artist with The Eggma Trio.  Tsai was born in 1983 to Steve Tsai's parents.  Her piano studies began some time after her birth, and were followed by cello studies.  She began to distinguish herself as a cellist and skyrocketed not just to the top of the middle school chairs, but to the All State orchestra three years in a row, before her final year of high school when she casually quit orchestra class.  Her interests include psychology research in human-computer interaction and cello.


<h2>[REDACTED], Flute</h2>

[REDACTED] is a featured guest artist with The [REDACTED] Trio.  [REDACTED], a flute major from the prestigious [REDACTED] School of Music, was so amazing that a collaboration would be an opportunity the struggling Eggma, or for that matter any group worldwide, could not afford to pass up.  She had already heard of BOHUSLAV and in fact had played one of his flute sonatas already.  This mix of artistry, coincidence, and the special guest star paradigm was something that had always typefied Eggma over the years.  The Bohuslav [REDACTED] music for [REDACTED] [REDACTED]'s appearance has not yet been passed out, but an unprecedented success is anticipated. Update: The music has been passed out and run through several times.


<h2>Lisa Lin, Flute</h2>

Lisa Lin is a the current permanent guest cellist artist with The [REDACTED] Trio.  [REDACTED], a flute major from the prestigious Texas A&M School of Music, was so amazing that a collaboration would be an opportunity the struggling Eggma, or for that matter any group worldwide, could not afford to pass up.  She enjoyed much of the same trios such as Brahms, Schumert, Eggma's arrangement of Camille Saint-Saens' The Swan, and songs from Wicked. This mix of artistry, coincidence, and the special permanent star paradigm was something that had occasionally typefied Eggma over the years. After the monumental undertakings of the Brhams B major trio, Tchaikovsky Trio Mvt 2, and  The Bohuslav [REDACTED] music for Schubert Trio has been passed out and ran through several times.
